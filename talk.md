Good evening everyone, thanks for having me.

My name is Fedor, I'm a student at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
I'm also doing some competitive programming as a hobby.

I'll briefly describe what competitive programming is.

A programming competition, or contest, generally involves the host presenting a
set of logical or mathematical problems to the contestants, and contestants are
required to write computer programs capable of solving each problem.

In most contests, the judging is done automatically by host machines, commonly
known as judges.
Every solution submitted by a contestant is run on the judge against a set of
(usually secret) test cases.
Normally, contest problems have an all-or-none scoring system, meaning that a
solution is "Accepted" if it produces satisfactory results on all test cases
run by the judge, and rejected otherwise.
Judging is based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for
writing successful solutions.

As Titus Winters said in one of his talks, "Engineering is
Programming integrated over time".
This saying resonated with me, because solving a task during a contest is
pretty much like a derivative of real engineering:

- Competitive programming is all about hacking in the moment.
- You have a fixed and well-defined problem.
